# Python Learning Progress 📖

## Overview
This repository contains my Python exercises as I build a **strong foundation** in programming.

## Topics Covered
✔ **Loops** - Basic iteration, nested loops, pattern printing  
✔ **Functions** - Writing modular and reusable code  
✔ **Lists** - Working with collections of data  
✔ **Math** - Implementing formulas and problem-solving  
✔ **Algorithms** - Sorting, searching, and recursion  

## Progress Tracking
